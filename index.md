Welcome to Island Wanderer

Island Wanderer is the perfect website for University of Hawaii students who want to explore the islands of Hawaii with other students. Students are able to log into the website and are immediately taken to the home page, which shows postings from other students, starting with the most recent posting. Users can then filter the postings by tags - locations, dates, people, etc. Students will have the option to save posts, message the poster, or post something themselves. They can also comment on a post. Students will also have access to a personal calendar, which will hold all the events the student wants to attend. Two ways to add events to the calendar is through manually entering an event, or directly addiing an event from a post. Furthermore, students can start private messages with other students, should they have any specific questions about a post or activity. Because students don't have to "friend" other students to see their posts/directly message them, there will be the option to block certain students, should there be any issues. 

The developers of this website are current University of Hawaii students who are passionate about exploring the Hawaiian Islands and love to connect with people through adventuring. If you have any comments or questions, you can contact the developers through creating and issue on the GitHub site.
